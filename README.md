Learning Tokens is an Open Source mechanism that uses the composable Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework (IWA TTF) to produce a Learning Token as a positive reinforcer that recognizes, registers, and rewards community engagement in collective learning and also certifies skills acquisition and competencies.

## Motivation
As we know, communities/organizations benefit from collaboration. Learning through interactions with others capitalizes on everybodyâ€™s resources and skills. Beyond independent work, individuals achieve higher levels of learning when knowledge grows collectively. Engagement and coordination become essential, and rewards can provide the incentives to motivate behavior.
That's why we propose a Learning Token as a positive reinforcer that recognizes, registers, and rewards community engagement in collective learning, certifying the acquisition of skills and competencies.

Communities that agree upon valuable behaviors can turn those behaviors into unique token representations of their value and set up clear rules for its creation and supply, able to resist modification or tampering, and, most important, capable of being transferred per-to-peer. Our Learning Token is proof of behaviors that benefit learning communities, individual members, and collectivity.

IWA TTF provides the necessary tools and artifacts that will be of use to us in order to define common token concepts with our requirements and particular behaviors, linking their base Token Classification Hierarchy with our Taxonomy of DLT/Blockchain Educational Opportunities as initial metadata for standard artifacts and control message descriptions.

There are robust foundations for this project. Hyperledger and Global Blockchain Business Association, GBBA, are Launch Associate Members of the Interwork Alliance, IWA. Digital currencies and NFT open-source repositories are available. This encouraged us to innovate and take advantage of the eThaler repository, the ongoing work of NEFERTI, and the IWA Github repositories for artifacts, so we could start defining the mechanism which impact, benefit and contribution on communities will be meaningful.

The goal is to build an open-source infrastructure where communities can engage, create and contribute the asset value of collective knowledge through four possible roles and sets of activities:

| Role | Activities |
| --- | --- |
| `Learners` | They study, consult, understand, absorb, ask questions, find their way, try new things, share knowledge, teach others and learn about learning. |
| `Educators` | They create content to facilitate, teach, tutor, guide, set objectives, give purpose, listen, reflect and explore new tools for teaching. |
| `Curators` | They oversee the collection of learning resources, select topics, evaluate content, find, filter, collect, organize and mix materials for teaching and learning. |
| `Maintainers` | They ensure the means of operation, track work in progress, inspect, conserve, repair, fix, maintain, follow up, document and communicate. |


Through this synergy, we believe we can address a marketplace infrastructure where we connect learners, educators, and curators. But also, to build a repository of interactions for maintainers to facilitate, keep, evaluate, and support. Whereas community stakeholders create collective knowledge, trusted educators certify learning skills and advanced competencies using Learning Tokens. To gain credibility and build reputation among individuals these Learning Tokens can be integrated into personal profiles, recognizing engagement and certified achievements of individuals, which will become valuable for the community of issuers, holders, and potential verifiers such as employers, investors, or sponsors.

## Roadmap - Milestones

We propose to work with Linux Foundation and GBBA GSMI Area 4. We already have our focal point with GSMI, and now we count with a focal point along side Hyperledger and Linux Foundations as well. 

| Milestone 1 | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| Hosting workshop for Business Case and Economic Model | Done | 
| Two virtual meetups and one workshop to engage communities and interested parties | Done |

| Milestone 2 | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| Delivering Report of Business Case and Economic Model | Done |
| Designing and reporting business definition of targeted tokens (base token types, behaviors, and properties) | Done | 

| Milestone 3 | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| Reusing and contributing with new artifacts to the eThaler, NEFERTI and IWA github repositories | In Progress |
| Gathering IWA partners, GBBA GSMI Area 4, Hyperledger Foundation, and Linux Foundation to comment upon our token definitions | In Progress |

| Milestone 4 | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| Final Report, written and Meetup Presentation | In Progress |

## Tokens Definition/Taxonomy

We start this process with a proposed Hybrid Token tf(tN,tF), that is, fungible with a class of non-fungible and fungible tokens.

- Token Variables according to the Token Taxonomy Initiative, TTI:
  - Token Type: Two types,
    - Fungible to reward engagement in the community.
    - Non-Fungible to certify accredited acquisition of skills.
  - Token Unit: Singleton, no subdivision.
  - Value Type: Intrinsic, the digital token itself is valuable.
  - Representation Type:
    - Common, for fungible engagement rewards, tokens are balances on a single DL, without individual identities.
    - Unique, for non-fungible certificates, NFTs with their own identities.
  - Template Type:
    - Single, without any child tokens, for engagement rewards
    - Hybrid, with a single parent and many possible child tokens, for certificates in paths of learning
  - Token Properties
    - Behavioral property, their value is determined through logic and calculation. Established and reviewed periodically by community consensus.
      - Transferable, for engagement rewards.
      - Non-transferable, for certificates of learning.
      - Indivisible/Whole, for rewards and certificates.
      - Mint-able, ability to issue new tokens for both types.
      - Role Support, ability to have roles defined to allow or prevent actions.
      - Burnable, ability to remove our Learning Tokens from the supply.
  - Property-Set artifact
    - To be defined at workshop.


This Token Formula shall advance to a consensus definition of our Learning Token.
